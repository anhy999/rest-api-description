# When the `documentation` label is added for documentation issues,
# this workflow copies the issue to the API team repo which can then 
# be transferred to the feature team that owns the problem endpoint 
# so they can resolve the documentation problem
# (we do not transfer the original issue so that the issue does not disappear for the contributor)
